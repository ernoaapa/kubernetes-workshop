ReplicaSet

Usually one does not create pods directly but create other resources like ReplicaSet's which creates and manages pods.
(This because if node fails then those pods are lost.)

Keeping pods healthy

```shell

workshop $ kubectl 

workshop $ 

```

Running multible instanses of the same pod

```shell

workshop $ kubectl 

workshop $ 

```

Automatically rescheduling pods after failure

```shell

workshop $ kubectl 

workshop $ 

```


Scaling pods horizontally



```shell

workshop $ kubectl 

workshop $ 

```
